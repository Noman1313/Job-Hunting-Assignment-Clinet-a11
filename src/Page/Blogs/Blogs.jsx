                Access tokens and refresh tokens are commonly used in authentication systems, especially in the context of OAuth 2.0 and similar protocols. They serve different purposes in the process of securing and authorizing access to resources.</h1>

            <h2>1. Access Token:
                - Purpose: An access token is a short-lived token that grants a client (an application) permission to access a specific resource or perform specific actions on behalf of a user. It acts as a key that provides temporary, limited access to protected resources.
                - How it works: When a user logs in or authorizes an application, an authorization server generates an access token. The client includes this token in its requests to the resource server (e.g., an API). The resource server checks the validity of the token and, if valid, grants access to the requested resource.
                - Storage on the client-side: Access tokens should be stored securely on the client-side, typically in memory, session storage, or a secure cookie. It essential to protect them from unauthorized access, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.</h2><br />

            <h2>2. Refresh Token:
                - Purpose: A refresh token is a long-lived token used to request a new access token when the original access token expires. It helps maintain the user session without requiring them to re-enter their credentials or reauthorize the application.
                - How it works: When the access token expires, the client can send the refresh token to the authorization server to obtain a new access token without requiring the user to re-authenticate. Refresh tokens are usually more extended-lived and have stricter security requirements.
                - Storage on the client-side: Refresh tokens must be stored securely on the client-side, typically in a secure HTTP-only cookie, ensuring that they are not exposed to JavaScript or unauthorized access. Storing them in a cookie also helps protect against cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.</h2><br />

            <h3>In summary, access tokens provide temporary access to resources, while refresh tokens allow clients to obtain new access tokens without user interaction when the original access token expires. Both access tokens and refresh tokens should be stored securely on the client-side to prevent unauthorized access and ensure the security of the authentication flow. It also crucial to follow best practices for token management, such as token rotation and proper token expiration settings, to enhance security.</h3>
